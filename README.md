# NutriScore
This is Food Image Recognition App: a smart camera app that uses deep learning algorithms to track nutrition from food images. This App is a promising tool for the real-time identification of food ingredients and for providing nutrition guidance. The app must provide with important nutrition-related information (e.g., calories, proteins, carbohydrates, etc.) for each food component detected by YOLOV3 model.
